I'm a teaching faculty and AI Safety Researcher in the [Heinz College of Information Systems and Public Policy](https://www.heinz.cmu.edu//) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu). I received a PhD in computer science / human-computer interaction (HCI) from Carnegie Mellon University's [School of Computer Science](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/) in August 2025.

In my research, I investigate and develop novel methodologies for identifying and measuring [AI Security and Safety vulnerabilities, policy compliance and risks](https://www.ingoresearch.org/amicable-contempt/), focusing on national and economic security and labor market risks. My research on AI Security & Safety focuses on AI red teaming; building tools and systems for AI Cyber Threat Intelligence and investigating AI Labor Market Fraud and Scams. Toward these focuses, I am an avid applied AI engineer, and seek to advance LLM and Agentic AI engineering practices through my empirical research.

Currently, I teach courses on [Applied Generative AI](https://evalf22.classes.andrewheiss.com/) and supervise student research on Agentic AI for AI Security Evaluations. Previously, I have taught courses on data science and user-centered research & evaluation methods. In the future, I hope to teach courses on [AI Security and AI Safety Evaluation Method](https://datavizs22.classes.andrewheiss.com/), [LLM and Agentic AI Engineering](https://datavizs22.classes.andrewheiss.com/) and [AI Labor Markets: Empirical Research and Policy ('AI Future of Work')](https://datavizs22.classes.andrewheiss.com/). 

I love teaching LLM, Agentic AI and RAG engineering using Python frameworks like Pytorch, Pydantic, uv, Milvus, faiss, Hydra, OmegaConf, Flask and SQLite3. 

Please feel free to contact me about research or learning interests.
